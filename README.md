# Hybrid EffNetV2M-ViT
Classification of Glioblastoma and Brain Metastasis Using a Hybrid EfficientNet-Vision Transformer Model

## Introduction

This repository implements a hybrid deep learning model combining EfficientNetV2M and ViT-B16 to classify glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases (BM) using MRI images. The model integrates EfficientNetV2M and ViT-B16 architectures to leverage the complementary strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to optimize tumor classification performance.
Additionally, the repository supports the standalone use of EfficientNetV2M, ViT-B16, and ResNet-50 as individual architectures.

## Installation

- **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/moralon2210/HybridEffNetV2M-ViT.git
  cd HybridEffNetV2M-ViT

- **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

- **Train the model:**

  Trains the model using train_config.json configurations.

  ```bash
  python main.py --mode train

- **Run inference (Evaluation with Ground Truth):**
  
  Runs inference on MRI data with ground truth to evaluate model performance, using inference_config.json configurations.

  ```bash
  python main.py --mode inference

- **Generate predictions (Without Ground Truth):**

  Produces predictions on MRI scans without ground truth, using predict_config.json configurations.

  ```bash
  python main.py --mode predict

## Configuration

- **Modify settings in the ****`configs/`**** directory** to adjust training parameters, data paths, and model settings.

## Dataset

- **Place dataset files in the ****`Dataset/`**** directory.**
- Ensure that the file structure matches the expected format (examples are provided within the folder).

## Results

- **Model outputs, logs, and performance metrics** are automatically saved.
- **Results are stored in the ****`results/`**** directory,** organized by mode.

## Pre-trained Weights

- **Available in the ****`weights/`**** directory**
- Includes pre-trained weights for hybrid EffNetV2M-ViT, EfficientNetV2M, ViT-B16 and ResNet-50.
- These weights are **trained over 5 folds and are used during inference and prediction modes** to generate results.
